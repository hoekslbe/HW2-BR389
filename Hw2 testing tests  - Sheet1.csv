,get_present,1,get method on a present key returns the correct val ,,,PASS
,get_sizeset,2,get sets valsize to the size of the returned obj,,,PASS
,get_flexiblsize,3,get does not impose a constant val_size in case ,,,PASS
,get_notthere,4,get on a nonpresent key returns NULLPTR,,,PASS
SPACE_USED,,,,,,
,empty_space,1,space_used returns 0 for empty cache,,,PASS
,add_increase,2,adding an item increases space_used,,,PASS
,add_remove,3,adding and removing maintains initial space used,,,PASS
,overwrite,4,overwriting w same key maintains space used,,,PASS
SET,,,,,,
,set_empty,1,value can be set to empty cache,,,PASS
,set_overwrite,2,overwriting w same key sets new val,,,PASS
,set_full,3,a val set to a full cache is stored,,,PASS
,set_mem,4,the cache won't store more than maxmem if,,,PASS
,,,more than maxmem is set,,,PASS

DEL,,,,,,
,delete_present,1,deleting a present item removes it,,,PASS
